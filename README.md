# Human_Activity_Recognition_Project

## Background
The datasets for this assignment came from a research that was done to predict the quality of executing an activity by using sensor and model based approach.  The research was unique in that traditionally the focus had been on "which" activities were performed, and less on "how well".

## Data
The dataset contained 5 classes (sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting) collected on 8 hours of activities of 4 healthy subjects.  Specifically, the activities were accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell. The subjects were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. A baseline performance index was established such that class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes (B, C, D, E) correspond to common mistakes.
